/**
 * Sidebar PROJECT drag — move a project INTO another project, or OUT to the top level.
 *
 * Projects are already draggable: `ReorderableList` sorts them with dnd-kit. Nesting rides that same
 * drag rather than adding a rival one, and the two are told apart by WHERE the pointer is, not by how
 * far it has travelled:
 *
 *   over a project's own block — its row and the session rows under it → add it as a subproject of
 *   that project, outlined whole
 *   anywhere else: a gap between rows, empty space below the list → a plain reorder, the project
 *   titles moving around the release point
 *
 * So there is no separate nest gesture and nothing to learn: a row says "in here", a gap says "here".
 * Nesting into an already-nested project happens by pointing at its row.
 *
 * What the release will do is said before it happens: a chip beside the pointer reads "Add subproject
 * to <name>" or "Top level", and the whole region it would land in is outlined. Both follow the list
 * as it scrolls, the outline is clipped to the pane the list lives in, and neither appears while the
 * answer is a reorder or a place a project cannot go: a discovered (auto) row owns no project
 * record, a project cannot be parented to itself or to one of its own descendants, and a project
 * already at the top level has nothing to pull out of. Row tooltips are muted for the length of the
 * drag, so the chip is the only text saying what is about to happen.
 *
 * An outdent clears the parent and then lets the list run its own reorder, so the project lands where
 * it was released instead of being pulled back to wherever it sat inside its old parent.
 *
 * The backend owns the same rule (`projects.set_parent`, which refuses looping moves); this module
 * only decides intent, paints it, and hands the move to the store.
