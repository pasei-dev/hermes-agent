 * before you drop. A policy with its own meaning on the pointer's position (a nest target, say) needs
 * that position to mean one thing, so while `quiet` says true the list reports a drop target that is
 * the DRAGGED item itself. Pinning `over` to the active item is what keeps the dragged row under the
 * pointer: dnd-kit's sortable transform is `displaceItem ? strategy(...) : null`, and `displaceItem`
 * needs `over` — so reporting NO target (an empty collision list) does not merely stop the reflow, it
 * nulls the dragged row's transform too and drops the row back into its original slot. `over` equal to
 * the active id makes the strategy yield a zero displacement, so the row holds still instead.
 *
 * The gate has to be HYSTERETIC, not instantaneous. Entering a row pins the crossing; leaving it
 * releases the crossing only once the pointer is clear of the row's box, so passing over a project and
 * coming back does not flip the reorder twice on the way through.
 *
 * `quiet` must be a PURE function of the pointer — a reflow here re-measures the rows the policy just
